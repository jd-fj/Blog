# Taylor's Blog Post

Today I started classes at **Epicodus**. I learned the following;

1. First I git init
2. Then I git add
3. Then I git commit

This week I would get _better_ at;

* remembering the git commit process
* working with terminal commands
* general markup techniques

## Next Week
Remember these wise saying from Bruce Lee
>Showing off is the fool's idea of glory.
